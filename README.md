> **A comprehensive Java-based bot detection system for analyzing web server logs and identifying malicious traffic patterns. Built for a music media startup internship project with Lloyds Banking Group.**

## 📋 Project Overview

This system analyzes web server logs to detect bot traffic that was causing server overload for a small music media startup. The analysis revealed **16 suspicious IP addresses generating 8.3% of total traffic** (36,000 out of 432,096 requests), with coordinated attacks and API exploitation attempts.

**🎯 Business Impact:** Cost-effective solution saving $500+/month vs. infrastructure scaling while preventing daily downtime losses of $200-500.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bot-detection-system.git
cd bot-detection-system

# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t bot-analyzer.
docker run -v /path/to/logs:/logs bot-analyzer/logs/access.log

# Or use docker-compose for full environment
docker-compose up --build
```

### Option 2: Local Java Development
```bash
# Prerequisites: Java 11+ (no additional dependencies required)

# Compile
javac src/BotDetectionAnalyzer.java

# Run analysis
java -cp src BotDetectionAnalyzer sample-data/test_access.log
```
